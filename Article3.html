					This amount is more than just a number, it represents the daily struggles of millions, especially in Mindanao, where poverty is most severe.
					Mindanao has a poverty rate of 36.2 percent, the highest in the country. Despite the region's rich natural resources, nearly 9 million people live below the poverty line.

					Despite these struggles, Mindanao has a lot of potential. Its natural resources, such as fertile land, minerals, and strong fishing communities, can be used to create more job opportunities.
					However, these resources have not been fully used because of poor infrastructure, lack of investment, and government neglect.
