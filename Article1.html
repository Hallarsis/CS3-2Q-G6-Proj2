					<a>P</a>overty in the Visayas region remains a critical issue in the Philippines, despite economic growth in recent years.
					According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA, 2023), poverty incidence in the Visayas is higher compared to Luzon, with significant disparities among its islands.
					This article examines the factors contributing to poverty in the Visayas and discusses efforts to address these challenges.
					The Visayas region relies heavily on agriculture and fisheries, industries vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change.
					Typhoons frequently damage crops and infrastructure, reducing income and productivity for small-scale farmers and fisherfolk (Department of Agriculture, n.d.).
					The limited diversification of industries in the region further restricts employment opportunities. Many areas in the Visayas suffer from inadequate infrastructure,such as poor road networks and limited access to electricity.

					Malnutrition and limited healthcare access are prevalent in poor communities across the Visayas.
					Inadequate healthcare infrastructure and insufficient government funding exacerbate these problems.
					Malnourished children face developmental challenges, which negatively impact their education and future economic prospects (Department of Health, 2023).
					Efforts to combat poverty in the Visayas include conditional cash transfer programs like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) and community-based projects funded by local and international NGOs.
					However, challenges such as corruption and inefficient program implementation reduce the effectiveness of these interventions
